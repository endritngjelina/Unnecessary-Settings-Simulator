# Unnecessary Settings Simulator

A lightweight, static HTML “simulator” that playfully explores what happens when settings screens get *way* too complicated.

This repo contains multiple standalone HTML pages (numbered versions) so you can open different iterations and compare ideas quickly.

## What’s in this repo

- `Unnecessary Settings Simulator 0.html`, `1.html`, `2.html`, …: Standalone pages / iterations.
- `README.md`: You’re reading it.
- `LICENSE`: MIT.

## How to run

No build step required.

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open any of the `Unnecessary Settings Simulator *.html` files in your browser.
3. Try different versions to see different UI/interaction experiments.

## Why this exists

This project is meant for:
- UI/UX prototyping practice
- Demonstrating “settings creep” and dark-pattern-adjacent complexity (in a harmless way)
- Quick iteration without frameworks or tooling

## Contributing

Ideas and PRs are welcome:
- Add a new numbered HTML file for a new iteration.
- Keep pages self-contained (prefer minimal dependencies).
- If you introduce shared assets (CSS/JS), consider a simple `/assets` folder and document it here.
